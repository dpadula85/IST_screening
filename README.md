- CSD subset: data regarding the molecules derived from the CSD

- ZINC subset: data regarding the molecules derived from ZINC

- TD_opt_candidates: $S_1$ and $T_1$ TDDFT/M06-2X/def2-TZVP optimised geometries. 

Within each subset folder: 

- MAIN: the database of molecules with TDDFT $\Delta E_{ST} < 0.5$ eV.

- CAS_a_b - computed vertical $S_1$ and $T_1$ energies (and $\Delta E_{ST}$) at the CASSCF/6-31G* level with Gaussian.
